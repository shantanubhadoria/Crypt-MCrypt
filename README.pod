=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a perl interface to libmcrypt c library. It exposes the crypto functions provided by the libmcrypt library in a perl interface 
with a binding code that accounts for null C strings in ciphertext or plain text.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 algorithm

contains the name of the algorithm used to decrypt encrypt blocks of data

=head2 mode 

contains the name of the L<block cipher mode of operation|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation> used to encrypt/decrypt blocks of data.

=head2 key

contains the key for the encryption decryption algorithm

=head2 Initialization Vector 

contains the Initialization for the first block of data in block cipher mode of operation. 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $self->decrypt($ciphertext)

decrypt blocks of ciphertext 

=head2 $self->encrypt($ciphertext)

encrypt blocks of data

=encoding utf-8

=head1 USAGE

=over

=item *

This module provides a object oriented interface to the libmcrypt library. It uses Mo, a scaled down version of Moose without any data checks to improve speed.
